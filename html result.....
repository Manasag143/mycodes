      "": "Hitachi views India as a high-growth market, and hence, operations of the company are strategically important to the group. The company not only manufactures an extensive range of products locally for the Indian market, but also exports to group entities globally. With the acquisition of 19.9% stake by Hitachi Ltd in Hitachi Energy Ltd in December 2022, Hitachi Energy India Limited becoming a 100% Hitachi owned entity. This further substantiates strategic importance of Indian market to ultimate parent Hitachi Limited. Hitachi Ltd sees India’s energy market strategically important with strong impetus for growth driven by significant investment being made by public sector towards Renewable Energy, electrification of Indian Railways, Metro expansion and improving ISTS and InSTS connectivity. Further, HEIL uses the Hitachi brand for all external corporate communication and has access to all group-level resources of the parent. Post the acquisition, there has been an operational integration in manufacturing, global procurement, marketing, and sales functions, with the application of global best practices. Furthermore, Hitachi also offers managerial support via delegates on the board of the company. Hence, Crisil Ratings believes Hitachi will continue to extend support to the company over the long term.",
