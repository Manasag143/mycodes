"1. The potential red flag you observed - Debt reduction is lower than expected  
Original Quote:  
""Vikrant Kashyap: Have you -- are you able to reduce any debt in quarter one in Middle East and India?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: So India, we are not reduced, but the cash balance has been increased to around INR75 crores, but we have not reduced any debt in Q1 in India and Middle East because Middle East we have not converted any showroom in Q1."" (Page 9)  

2. The potential red flag you observed - Margin pressure/Competition intensifying/Cost inflation  
Original Quote:  
""Pulkit Singhal: Thank you for the opportunity and congrats on the good set of performance. Just the first question is really on the margins, which seems to have been elusive. I mean looking at the company for the last two years, we seem to be executing quite well in terms of store expansions and revenue growth and clearly delivering higher than expected there. But margin expansion just has been completely elusive.  
And I find it surprising your comment that while growing at 30% growth and 12% SSSG, I mean, which is quite healthy, you're still talking about high competitive intensity kind of quite contradictory that with such high growth rates, we have to invest so high. So can you talk about this a bit more? I mean we don't expect with lower revenue growth rates that you would not have to invest in the business. And it's only during a higher revenue growth that you expect margin expansion.  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: Yes. So you're right. We are -- meaning somewhere we have missed out on the operating leverage for advertisements that's why I told you that even Q1, it was a miss. And regarding competition, I will tell you where in new markets, where we assume that we will not spend too much because the brand is already aware and the location is the only thing which has to be communicated.  
When you see the local players, regional players or the micro market players there becoming extremely active because of our showroom launch then we will have to increase the noise level there. Otherwise, we will lose our market share. And existing local players they increase their activity around our launch time. So that is where we also put more money so that we don't end up losing the market share or we don't end up taking out lesser from the competition."" (Page 12-13)  

3. The potential red flag you observed - Debt high/Increase in borrowing cost  
Original Quote:  
""Vikrant Kashyap: My question is how are you going to address this? Because if you continue to grow at a higher level, but bottom line is not expanding related to the top line, it will going to impact your overall performance? So, what are the steps you are taking to improve the bottom line in the businesses  
Sanjay Raghuraman: Finance costs will be taken care because we told you when we convert stores, that money is going to reduce our debt. Okay. And again, FOCO, when you do FOCO showrooms, the margins will come down. And surely, that will have an impact on the gross margin. Okay. And interest, if you look at actually, the interest rates have been going up last year. So next year, that will be the base, right? So then again, we will not have this kind of issue is what we feel. So interest rates have been going up over the past year, one year, in that region.  
And we are also beginning to repay loans now because of conversion. So all put together, interest part will be taken care but other area where FOCO showrooms will surely reduce our margin. We cannot have the own store margin. So that should be the way we should look at it."" (Page 9)  

4. The potential red flag you observed - Attrition  
Original Quote:  
""Ashish Kanodia: The second question is on the MyKalyan front. So has there been any change in strategy, because when I look at the number of employees under MyKalyan, that has declined for the first time in the last few quarters. So has there been any change in that?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: No. So what will happen usually MyKalyan also use a lot of front-ended staff, because we keep on growing the MyKalyan network, okay? But now it is the franchisees call whether they need a MyKalyan or local marketing. So we give them two options, whether they want local marketing to be done in that region, or they want MyKalyan infrastructure. So as we speak now, people have started coming back because it's all one year, 1.5 year showroom, almost a year done. So now they are enough of local marketing, and they want us to open MyKalyan. So now you should ideally see ramp up of MyKalyan and employees also."" (Page 10)  

5. The potential red flag you observed - Inventory levels gone up  
Original Quote:  
""Gaurav Jogani: And sir, what's the impact on the inventory because of this custom duty cut?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: Approximately, we have -- it will be in the range of INR 120 crores, INR 130 crores.  
Gaurav Jogani: Overall, the impact. Okay.  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: Overall impact, yes. It should come out, meaning in Q2 plus Q3."" (Page 5)  

6. The potential red flag you observed - Challenging environment/Competition intensifying  
Original Quote:  
""Ramesh Kalyanaraman: So I think this will settle down in this level for some time because the expansion now, the 80 showrooms which we are opening in this financial year are predominantly in non-South tier two, tier three markets where studded ratio cannot be like tier 1 or Metro. Major showroom network expansion is happening in that area. So I think mid to late 20s, studded ratio will be the ideal number for maybe in the next couple of years -- next couple of quarters sorry."" (Page 11)  
And  
""Vikrant Kashyap: One question on competitive intensity. So, in the recent, the last week event one of the big players given a signal that they are entering into a jewelry retailing business and they have given a guidance of investing INR 5,000 crores. And most of the showrooms that they're targeting non-south markets, where you have been also expanding there. So given this increasing competitive intensity, how do you place Kalyan going ahead?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: It has to be -- even now we are talking the 35%, 40% of organized segment. So there are -- there is an easy vacuum or easy space for at least three or four more players in the sector. That is the first thing which we have to understand.  
Second thing is that if a good player comes, it is good for all organized players and market is also big enough. And if you look at your comment on one particular brand it is too early to comment because each brand will have their own strategy. And the strategy has not been revealed yet because it's too early for us to understand the strategy of the brand, which launched recently.  
But Kalyan, it's a very unique kind of strategy which we have where it's a hyper-local brand. In each region, we behave in such a way that it's a part of the region. So it takes time even for a new brand to come and do the same, it takes good number of years to do the same if they intend to replica. So we don't see any immediate competition coming in. But of course, there will be new stores of the brands coming near to us, and they will also be catering a different segment of customers."" (Page 9-10)  

7. The potential red flag you observed - One-off expenses/Margin pressure  
Original Quote:  
""Sanjay Raghuraman: Yes, ideally, we should. But Q1 also we missed because as I mentioned now, the marketing spend was a bit on a higher note than it should have been, especially because of the high gold prices and competition in the local -- by the local players. Regional players were very high in certain markets, so we do not want to lose market share.  
So again, the operating leverage we thought would come from marketing, did not come. And that is why the PBT did not grow more than our revenue. But Q2, I think we should because the revenue growth which we see now on ground, I think roughly it will happen. So the competition -- if competition reacts then we'll have to react in terms of marketing. That's why we are not able to do it. But I think on a yearly basis, the objective will be achieved. In India, we are already at 4.8% PBT, just to – in our view."" (Page 7)  

8. The potential red flag you observed - Attrition/Operational issues  
Original Quote:  
""Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ashish Kanodia from Citibank. Please go ahead.  
Ashish Kanodia: Hi, team. Congrats on a good set of numbers. Ramesh the first question was on the operating leverage. So I understand that ad spend was higher because of the volatility in gold price. But if I just look at the employee cost and other expenses, I think that has also increased on a Y-o-Y basis. So, is it more to do with the fact that some of the expenses have been front loaded because we plan to bring 35 stores over the next 2 months or so. So -- and maybe in the second half, we will see a much higher operating leverage, Is that the right way to look at the employee cost and other expenses?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: Yeah, that's what I told you before, because we are -- employee cost, we are, of course, adding a lot of employees or showrooms, which has to come in the Q2 because we want to add as many as showrooms possible before the festive Diwali. So there are some front-end expenses. And advertisement, it is related to the local competition activity about -- meaning their noise level, we all put together.  
So it can vary, wherein, in Q2 as we speak, we think that this is going to come out, because of the revenue growth, which we have. And expenses about employees surely, there are some front-ended expenses. As we are very, very simple is that our SSGs are in the range of 20% to 30%, but our ad spend increased – are in the range of 20%. So that is the gap, which we are seeing mainly focusing."" (Page 10-11)  

9. The potential red flag you observed - Inventory levels gone up/Increasing working capital  
Original Quote:  
""Ramesh Kalyanaraman: So because of this custom duty, high customs duty, it is always an incentive to do -- without invoice and buying without invoice and stuff for unorganized players, right? That can be an incentive for the customer also, because they can tell the customer that the price can be lesser or GST will not be paid and stuff. But now, things are becoming more transparent because the margins are lesser, no. Hope you understood."" (Page 13)  
And  
""Pulkit Singhal: So actually, the question like was -- that's interesting to know. The question also was to try to see if the people are competing with are actually having that custom duty arbitrage, which was allowing them to be profitable, et cetera. And now that arbitrage goes away from them.  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: So because of this custom duty, high customs duty, it is always an incentive to do -- without invoice and buying without invoice and stuff for unorganized players, right? That can be an incentive for the customer also, because they can tell the customer that the price can be lesser or GST will not be paid and stuff. But now, things are becoming more transparent because the margins are lesser, no. Hope you understood."" (Page 13)
