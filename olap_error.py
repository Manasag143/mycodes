Function Selection Optimization: Migrated from passing 29 functions simultaneously in prompts to a YAML-based configuration with intelligent keyword matching for dynamic function selection, significantly improving processing efficiency and reducing token overhead.
Error Propagation System: Implemented comprehensive error handling mechanism that captures query failures and propagates detailed error context through the system pipeline to enable systematic debugging and resolution.
Query Management APIs: Developed two new REST APIs - a query editing endpoint for real-time query modification and a regeneration API for reprocessing failed requests with enhanced parameters and context.
Intelligent Error Injection: Built an error correction system that identifies incomplete or incorrect response segments and automatically injects missing data or corrects erroneous components without full query reprocessing.
Response Quality Assurance: Established automated validation layers that detect response anomalies and trigger appropriate correction mechanisms to ensure consistent output quality.
Performance Monitoring: Integrated comprehensive logging and monitoring across all components to track system performance, error rates, and successful resolution patterns for continuous improvement.
